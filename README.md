# Waasabi HLS-IPFS proof of concept

Peer-to-peer video- and live streaming experiment for the [Waasabi](https://waasabi.org) system. This proof-of-concept demonstrates publishing live and on-demand video streams on the IPFS network (using libp2p) and accessing them from a web browser.

This initial proof of concept is part of a research endeavor for building a better, more accessible live streaming system that relies on the viewers for additional distribution bandwidth, making it easier for individuals to create online events without large investment into streaming infrastructure, or being forced to rely on infrastructure provided free-of-charge, but never truly "free" by large tech giants.

Furthermore, a custom streaming server makes further user experience experimentation for Waasabi possible, even for features that would not be possible with the usual suspects listed above (e.g. instant, per-talk replays, disjunct live streams with custom experiences in the breaks, etc.).
